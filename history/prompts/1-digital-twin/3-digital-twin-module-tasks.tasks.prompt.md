# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text


## Response Text

Generated comprehensive task list for the Digital Twin Module (Module 2) following the specification and implementation plan. The tasks.md file includes:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - Creating directory structure and researching existing Docusaurus configuration
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** - Setting up sidebar configuration and verifying development environment
3. **Phase 3: User Story 1** - Creating the Gazebo Physics chapter with content on physics engines, collision detection, and rigid body dynamics
4. **Phase 4: User Story 2** - Creating the Unity Environments chapter with content on Unity physics and robotics packages
5. **Phase 5: User Story 3** - Creating the Simulated Sensors chapter with content on various sensor types and perception
6. **Phase 6: Polish** - Cross-cutting concerns and final validation

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. Each task includes specific file paths and clear descriptions. The implementation strategy supports MVP-first delivery with User Story 1 as the initial priority, followed by incremental delivery of additional stories.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive task list (specs/1-digital-twin/tasks.md) with 31 specific, actionable tasks organized by phase and user story. The tasks are ready for implementation and follow all required formatting guidelines with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.
