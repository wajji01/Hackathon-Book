# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text

- Add Module 3 to the Docusaurus course structure.
- Create three chapter .md files (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2 Navigation) and register them in the Docusaurus sidebar.

## Response Text

Completed comprehensive planning for the AI-Robot Brain Module (Module 3) including:

1. Created detailed implementation plan with technical context
2. Performed constitution check ensuring alignment with project principles
3. Generated research document resolving all clarifications about Docusaurus structure, NVIDIA Isaac™ documentation, and Nav2 integration
4. Designed data model for chapter documents and navigation entities
5. Created API contracts for documentation endpoints
6. Developed quickstart guide for module development
7. Updated agent context with relevant technologies and project structure

The plan addresses all requirements from the user input, including adding Module 3 to the Docusaurus course structure and preparing for the creation of three chapter files (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2 Navigation) that will be registered in the Docusaurus sidebar.

## Outcome

Planning phase successfully completed for AI-Robot Brain Module. The implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for creating three chapters (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2 Navigation) and integrating them into the Docusaurus course structure with proper sidebar registration. All necessary artifacts have been created to proceed to the implementation phase.
