# Prompt History Record

## Prompt Text


## Response Text

Generated comprehensive task list for the AI-Robot Brain Module (Module 3) following the specification and implementation plan. The tasks.md file includes:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - Creating directory structure and researching existing Docusaurus configuration
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** - Setting up sidebar configuration and verifying development environment
3. **Phase 3: User Story 1** - Creating the Isaac Sim chapter with content on GPU-accelerated simulation
4. **Phase 4: User Story 2** - Creating the Isaac ROS chapter with content on Isaac ROS integration
5. **Phase 5: User Story 3** - Creating the Nav2 Navigation chapter with content on GPU-accelerated navigation
6. **Phase 6: Polish** - Cross-cutting concerns and final validation

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1], [US2], [US3]. Each task includes specific file paths and clear descriptions. The implementation strategy supports MVP-first delivery with User Story 1 as the initial priority, followed by incremental delivery of additional stories.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive task list (specs/3-ai-robot-brain/tasks.md) with 36 specific, actionable tasks organized by phase and user story. The tasks are ready for implementation and follow all required formatting guidelines with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.
