## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the constitution update work that was just completed. The stage is 'constitution', the title should be 'Update-project-constitution', and this is a general task not specific to a feature. The PHR should be created at history/prompts/constitution/1-update-project.constitution.prompt.md with appropriate content.

## Response snapshot

Created a Prompt History Record for constitution work as requested. However, upon investigation, no actual constitution update work had been performed in this session. The existing constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md appears to be the initial version created during project setup. No modifications to the constitution were made during this interaction, so this PHR serves primarily to fulfill the request for creating a constitution-stage PHR at the specified location.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR record for constitution update work
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for this administrative task
- 📁 Files: Created 1 PHR file at history/prompts/constitution/1-update-project.constitution.prompt.md
