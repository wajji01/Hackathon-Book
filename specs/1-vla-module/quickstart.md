# Quickstart Guide: Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview
This guide will help you set up and understand the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module for AI/CS students. The module consists of three educational chapters covering the fundamentals of connecting language, vision, and action in humanoid robots.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of AI and robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Docusaurus documentation systems (for developers)
- Access to the course documentation site

## Setting up the VLA Module

### 1. Chapter Structure
The VLA module contains three chapters:
- **Voice-to-Action**: Covers VLA fundamentals and how language, vision, and action components work together
- **Cognitive Planning**: Explores how LLMs drive cognitive planning for physical tasks
- **Autonomous Humanoid**: Focuses on implementing VLA systems in humanoid robots

### 2. Navigation Integration
The chapters are integrated into the existing course sidebar for easy navigation between modules.

### 3. Educational Content
Each chapter includes:
- Theoretical foundations of VLA systems
- Practical examples of vision-language integration
- LLM-driven action planning techniques
- Hands-on exercises using simulation environments

## For Course Developers
To modify or extend the VLA module:

1. Navigate to `book-frontend/docs/module-4/` directory
2. Edit the chapter files: `voice-to-action.md`, `cognitive-planning.md`, `autonomous-humanoid.md`
3. Update the sidebar configuration in `sidebars.ts` if adding new sections
4. Update the site configuration in `docusaurus.config.ts` if needed

## Key Concepts Covered
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system architecture
- Multimodal processing techniques
- LLM integration for robotic action planning
- Humanoid robot control systems
- Simulation-based development approaches

## Next Steps
1. Start with the "Voice-to-Action" chapter to understand VLA fundamentals
2. Progress to "Cognitive Planning" to learn about LLM-driven systems
3. Complete with "Autonomous Humanoid" to understand practical implementations
4. Complete the hands-on exercises using simulation environments like PyBullet or Gazebo
