# Introduction to ROS 2 Robotics Module

Welcome to the educational module on **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** for AI and Computer Science students. This module focuses on teaching the fundamentals of ROS 2 as middleware for humanoid robot control, connecting AI logic to physical actions.

## About This Module

This educational module is structured into three comprehensive chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understanding the purpose and architecture of ROS 2, communication patterns (nodes, topics, services, actions)
2. **Robot Control Programming** - Programming interfaces, publishers, subscribers, services, and bridging AI agents to robot controllers
3. **Robot Description and Modeling** - Robot description formats, links, joints, sensors, and model visualization concepts

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI/CS students with a Python background who are new to robotics. Each chapter builds upon the previous one to provide a comprehensive understanding of how ROS 2 enables communication and control in robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the architecture and purpose of ROS 2 in robotic systems
- Implement communication patterns using ROS 2 programming interfaces
- Describe humanoid robots using robot description formats
- Bridge AI agents to robot control systems effectively

## Getting Started

Navigate to the ROS 2 Module section in the sidebar to begin with Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals, which establishes the foundational knowledge needed for the subsequent chapters.
