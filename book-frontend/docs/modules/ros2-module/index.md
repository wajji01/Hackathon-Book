# Introduction to the Robotic Nervous System Module

Welcome to the educational module on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for AI and Computer Science students. This module is designed to teach you the fundamentals of ROS 2, which serves as middleware for humanoid robot control, connecting AI logic to physical actions.

## About This Module

This educational module is structured into three comprehensive chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understanding the purpose and architecture of ROS 2, communication patterns (nodes, topics, services, actions)
2. **Robot Control Programming** - Programming interfaces, publishers, subscribers, services, and bridging AI agents to robot controllers
3. **Robot Description and Modeling** - Robot description formats, links, joints, sensors, and model visualization concepts

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI/CS students with a Python background who are new to robotics. Each chapter builds upon the previous one to provide a comprehensive understanding of how ROS 2 enables communication and control in robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the architecture and purpose of ROS 2 in robotic systems
- Implement communication patterns using ROS 2 programming interfaces
- Describe humanoid robots using robot description formats
- Bridge AI agents to robot control systems effectively

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals to establish the foundational knowledge needed for the subsequent chapters.

## Module Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for AI and Computer Science students. The three chapters build upon each other to provide both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills:

- **Chapter 1**: ROS 2 Fundamentals - Core concepts and architecture
- **Chapter 2**: Robot Control Programming - Practical implementation with Python
- **Chapter 3**: Robot Description and Modeling - Creating robot models with URDF
